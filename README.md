👋 Hey there, I’m FloHoliday!

	•	🌊 **Adventurer at heart **, data explorer by day, and when the waves are good, you’ll find me on a surfboard or carving fresh powder on my snowboard. 🏄‍♂️🏂
	•	🔍 Currently diving deep into the realms of **Data Science, Machine Learning, and Data Visualization** — but don’t worry, I still keep my motorcycle 🏍️ mechanic roots close!
	•	💡 Always on the hunt **to learn more!** Right now, it’s all about algorithms and data structures 🧠, but sometimes I wish they could be as simple as a torque wrench…
	•	💼 Looking for collaborations where creativity meets tech. Whether it’s solving cool problems or brainstorming wild ideas, I’m down for it all! 🤯
	•	📬 Want to chat? Drop me a message on LinkedIn, I’m always up for a good conversation.
	•	🎉 Fun Fact: I went from a motorcycle apprenticeship to earning a Mechanical Engineering degree, working in the field, traveling the world, and now I’m back in school studying Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning at HSLU — talk about a ride! 🔧➡️🎓➡️🌍➡️🤖
	•	🛠️ Oh, and by the way, I’m on the lookout for a part-time job to balance with my studies. If you need an AI enthusiast with a side of adventure, I’m your person!

**Things I’m obsessed with:

	•	Surfing 🌊
	•	Art that sparks curiosity 🎨
	•	Living life to the fullest! 🌟

Let’s connect and see where the journey takes us! 🚀**
